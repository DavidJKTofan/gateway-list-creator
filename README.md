# gateway-list-creator

Automatically fetch the first 4999 hostnames from a list from [FilterLists](https://filterlists.com/) and download it as a CSV file.

This way you can easily use that list for further analysis or in other tools, such as [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/lists/).

## Automatically create and upload Lists

By using this form on [Create Zero Trust List on Cloudflare Gateway](https://gateway-list-creator.pages.dev/create), you can automatically create and upload the List on your Cloudflare Zero Trust account.
